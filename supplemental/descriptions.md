Helping you learn Bible verses by heart

## long description:

This app provides an easy and effective way to learn Bible verses by heart. It assumes that you'll spend at least a few minutes every day learning new verses or reviewing old ones.

Features:

- Organize your verses into collections. 
- The practice page will ask you to quote whichever verses are due that day. 
- Quote the verse to yourself and then click the Show button to see the answer. 
- If you almost know the verse but can't quite remember it, you can ask for a hint. 
- The app uses a spaced repetition learning strategy where you practice difficult verses every day and easy verses less frequently.
