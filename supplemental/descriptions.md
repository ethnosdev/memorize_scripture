Helping you learn Bible verses by heart

## long description:

Memorize Scripture is an easy and effective way to learn Bible verses by heart. The app assumes that you'll spend at least a few minutes every day learning new verses or reviewing old ones.

Features:

- Organize your verses into collections. For example, a key verse collection or a passage collection with all of the verses in Psalm 23.
- The practice page will ask you to quote whichever verses are due that day. You'll be shown a prompt, which could be the verse reference or the previous verse (if you're working on a longer passage). Quote the verse to yourself and then click the Show button to see the answer. 
- If you almost know the verse but can't quite remember it, you can ask for a hint. There are two kinds of hints: the first letter of every word or the next full word in the verse.
- The app uses a spaced repetition learning strategy where you practice difficult verses every day and easy verses less frequently.

The developer, EthnosDev, believes that God's Word shouldn't be monetized. For that reason, this app doesn't contain any ads or sell anything, not even your personal data. The app is a gift to you to help you meditate on God's Word and grow in your walk with Jesus.

Since this is an early version of the app, many more features are planned for the future. You can help by giving your feedback to the developer about any bugs you find or features you wish were there. You'll find the contact email on the About page inside the app.
