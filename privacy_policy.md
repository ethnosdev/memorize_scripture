# Memorize Scripture Privacy Policy

## Effective Date: November 13, 2023

Welcome to the Memorize Scripture app. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information and user data.

## Collection of Personal Information

When you create an account in the Memorize Scripture app, we collect your email address. This is the only personal information we gather. Creating an account is not mandatory; you can still use the app without an account, and in such cases, no personal information is collected.

## Collection and Use of User Data

In addition to personal information, we collect and store your memory verse and practice data. This data is used to sync your progress across devices. We may also use this data internally to improve the app's functionality and user experience. The data is stored using a third-party cloud storage database solution named Supabase. We do not sell or use your data for any other purposes.

## Data Security

We take the security of your data seriously. All online data is stored securely in a Supabase database, and we implement industry-standard measures to protect your personal information and user data from unauthorized access or misuse.

## User Control Over Data

You have full control over your data. If you wish to delete your account, you can do so through the Account screen in the app. Deleting your account will remove your personal information and user data from our online servers. However, it will not delete the data stored locally on your device. To remove local data, you may uninstall the app.

## Non-Account Users

Users who choose not to create an account can still use the app with all its features. For such users, no personal information or user data is stored online.

## Policy Changes

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted as an update of the app, and you are advised to regularly view our most recent privacy policy.
