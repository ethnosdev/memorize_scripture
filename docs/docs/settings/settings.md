## Dark mode

Choose dark mode to make it easier on your eyes if you practice your verses early in the morning before it gets light.

## Max new verses per day

This is the maximum number of new verses the app will show you every day. Set it to a number like 5 or 10 if you don't want to get too many new verses in one day.

This setting is useful when you reset the due date for all of the verses in a collection, but you don't want to practice them all at once.

## Max days between reviews

You can ensure that every verse will show up at least once a month (or once every x days) no matter how many times you've marked a verse Good or Easy. If that's what you want, set this option to 30 days. Now, the Good and Easy buttons will never exceed 30.

## Two-button response

The default is to show four response buttons on the practice screen:

<div class="bordered-image">

</div>

If you turn this setting on, you'll have two buttons:

</div>

## Notifications

Turn on the **Daily reminder** to get daily notifications reminding you to review your verses. Once on, chose the **Time** option to set the notification time.

Congratulations! You've finished the tutorial!
