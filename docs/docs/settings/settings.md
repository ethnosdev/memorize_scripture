## Dark mode

Choose dark mode to make it easier on your eyes if you practice your verses early in the morning before it gets light.

## Max new verses per day

This is the maximum number of new verses the app will show you every day. The default is 10. Set it to a lower number if you don't want to have so many new verses in one day.

This setting is useful when you reset the due date for all of the verses in a collection but you don't want to practice them all at once.

:::tip
Rather than entering a lot of new verses at once and setting the max new verses to a low number like 1, it's generally better to wait to enter a new verse until you're ready to start learning it.

## Two-button response

The default is to show two response buttons on the practice screen:

<div class="bordered-image">

</div>

If you turn this setting off, you'll have four buttons:
